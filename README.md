# Lab: Class 13  -- CAPS QUEUE SERVER

**Author**: Ryan Tipper
**Version**: 1.0.0

# Pull Request

# Heroku Deployment
- https://rtipper-queue-server.herokuapp.com/

## Overview - 
Implement a “queue” system so that nothing gets lost. Every event sent will be logged and held onto by the server until the intended recipient acknowledges that they received the message. At any time, a subscriber can get all of the messages they might have missed.

In this final phase, we’ll be building out the queue itself, getting our vendors subscribed to it, and focusing on just one event - delivered to set the pattern for subscribing to, and working with queues.
